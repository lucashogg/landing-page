# landing-page

## About

> For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building an entire website landing page (based on the example provided) from scratch. The page consists of a few different sections containing varying information. This exercise is intended to help strengthen HTML and CSS, specifically Flexbox.
